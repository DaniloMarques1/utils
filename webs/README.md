## Web

The idea is to be able to open firefox to search in specific websites.

For example if i wanted to search for a word in a portuguese dictionary i could type:

```shell
webs dic Raposa
```

This will open firefox in the https://www.dicio.com.br/ website and will show us the meaning of the world "Raposa".

To search on duckduckgo i would do

```shell
webs duc golang
```
